- Strip ending spaces from strings
- Remove: \u00b1 (basement_area, lot_size, gla, age)
- Exclude/ignore the following features: ["site_dimensions", "units_sq_ft", "lot_size", "lot_size_sf", "water_heater", "exterior_finish", 
            "style", "levels", "effective_age", "subject_age", "age", "effective_date", "close_date", "sale_date"]

- bed_count and num_beds: if "2+1", add numbers to create a total number of bedrooms (convert to integer)
- num_baths and bath_count: split into full_baths and half_baths (both integers) - extract 2 numbers, assign respectively
- gla
    - can have "1 SqFt", "1 sqft" "1 sf" "1+/-SqFt" "1 SqFt\u00b1", "1 SqM"
    - convert sqm to sqft, then extract num and remove unit. Convert to float
- sale_price: remove comma, convert to float

- Remove any +/-
- Remove Units (gla, distance_to_subject)

- "address": "152 Colombo Acres "
- City Province Zip: Kingston ON K7M 6V1

- flooring: can split by ["and", ","] and lower()
- water_heater: not very std, can lower() and remove -, +/- but it might not help
- age: new -> 0
    - effective vs subject?
- site_dimensions, exterior_finish cannot be standardized

- subj municipality_district can be found in property public_remarks

- style/levels: go by prefix
    - story -> storey
    - two or 2 -> 2-storey
    - three or 3 -> 3-storey
- Convert lot_size to sq ft
    - Subj: 
        - if units_sq_ft == "Acres", extract num and convert to "SqFt" and don't use
        - elif units_sq_ft == "SqM"
    - acres, Acre, Acres
    - Comp:
        - ex. "lot_size": "225x217 /1.24 Acres"
            - if "ac" (due to ac\u00b1) in .lower(), go backward from a until reach digit, then read backward until the first char that's not number or "."
        - can have "Sq M" or "SQ M" or "SqM" -> extract the num before Sq M (ex. "n/a x n/a 500 SQ M", "486 Sq M")
            - if "sqm" or "sq m" in .lower(), go backward from s until reach digit, then read backward until the first char that's not number or "."
        - THEN rename to lot_size_sf
